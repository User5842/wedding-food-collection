# Wedding Food Collection

My (soon-to-be) wife and I needed a simple way to collect responses from our guests regarding their food choices. Since she is a PM (product manager) and I am a software engineer, we put our heads together, and I developed the form collection website.

It's a simple solution that exposed me to technologies I have always wanted to explore further, specifically [zod](https://zod.dev/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

I wasn't originally planning on uploading this. Still, because it ended up being a more-than-trivial-sized project, doing so would serve, if anything, as a portfolio item.
